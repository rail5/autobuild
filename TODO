The numbering to this todo list does not necessarily imply any order of priority.
TODO:

- #1 | Customizable build farm
	User-provided ISOs, etc, added on to the build farm list
	Option to build only *some* of the VMs (eg, i386 but not arm64)

- #2 | Add option for "extra commands" / extra files to be added to Github Release pages
	- Should be an option in the autobuild config script:
		- Pre-build script
		- Post-build script
		- Extra files to add to releases
	- Should be configured PER-PACKAGE

- #3 | Autobuild should be able to "update" or "replace" a release which has already been made
	For example, a GitHub release page has already been published for package Foo 1.2.3
	This release page included binaries for x86_64 and i386
	The developer would now like to run autobuild to create a package for arm64, without having to re-publish the package as a "new version" just because of a change in the way it's distributed.
	This change would go nicely with #2.

- #4 | Add option to run build-farm VMs in parallel
	User should be able to choose how many VMs run simultaneously

- #5 | Build an optional web interface?
	Autobuild could be deployed to some server somewhere and you could have it distribute your changes remotely. Might be nice.

- #6 | Consolidate the contents of the autobuild-setup script into either (1) the main script or (2) a config file
	No reason we should have two scripts to this package.
