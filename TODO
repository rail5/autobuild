TODO:
- Customizable build farm
	User-provided ISOs, etc, added on to the build farm list
	Option to build only *some* of the VMs (eg, i386 but not arm64)

- Some QoL:
	- Default "yes" on y/n prompts
	- 'autobuild -s' should have an option to edit the config then and there rather than having to run 'autobuild -c' first
