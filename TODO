TODO:
- Customizable build farm

- POSIX-compliant shell(?)

- Add function to update/upgrade the software in the build farm VMs

- Package autobuild itself as a Debian package
	Store everything (config, builds, build-farm etc etc) under a /var/ subdirectory
	Package should create an autobuild user with permissions to that subdirectory
	Make sure that user config etc is not overwritten by future upgrades
