TODO:

- Modularize as much as possible

- Customizable build farm

- (DONE) Rather than creating a new directory named {current-timestamp} in the base directory for builds, this should all happen in a "builds" subdirectory

- (DONE) There should also be a "clean-up" function

- POSIX-compliant shell

- One single configuration file

- (IN PROGRESS) Remove PHP scripts
	The dpkg-dev package is required for one of the PHP replacements, which uses the 'dpkg-parsechangelog' utility. The 'dpkg-dev' package is provided by 'build-essential'

- If the user is pushing to a git-based Debian repository, don't clone it every single time. Store it once and leave it in the config file

- Remove Windows cross-compilation & MXE setup. This is far too niche to be worth maintaining.

- Add function to update/upgrade the software in the build farm VMs
