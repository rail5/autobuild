TODO:

- Modularize as much as possible

- Customizable build farm

- (DONE) Rather than creating a new directory named {current-timestamp} in the base directory for builds, this should all happen in a "builds" subdirectory

- There should also be a "clean-up" function

- POSIX-compliant shell

- One single configuration file

- Remove PHP scripts

- If the user is pushing to a git-based Debian repository, don't clone it every single time. Store it once and leave it in the config file
