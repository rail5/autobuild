TODO:

- Modularize as much as possible
	Separate tasks into separate functions, place functions in INCLUDE file(s)

- Customizable build farm

- (DONE) Rather than creating a new directory named {current-timestamp} in the base directory for builds, this should all happen in a "builds" subdirectory

- (DONE) There should also be a "clean-up" function

- POSIX-compliant shell

- One single configuration file

- (DONE) Remove PHP scripts
	The package 'dpkg-dev' is required for one of the PHP replacements, which uses the 'dpkg-parsechangelog' utility. The 'dpkg-dev' package is provided by 'build-essential'

	The package 'jq' is required for another of the PHP replacements in order to parse some JSON.

- If the user is pushing to a git-based Debian repository, don't clone it every single time. Store it once and leave it in the config file

- (IN PROGRESS) Remove Windows cross-compilation & MXE setup. This is far too niche to be worth maintaining.

- Add function to update/upgrade the software in the build farm VMs

- Add non-interactive mode
