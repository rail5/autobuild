TODO:
- Customizable build farm
	User-provided ISOs, etc, added on to the build farm list
	Option to build only *some* of the VMs (eg, i386 but not arm64)

- Some QoL:
	- Default "yes" on y/n prompts
	- 'autobuild -s' should have an option to edit the config then and there rather than having to run 'autobuild -c' first

- There isn't any mechanism yet to detect problems in the build-farm VMs. There should be some kind of error reporting at the very least. Maybe automatic handling for the most likely errors when they're detected

- Add option for "extra commands" / extra files to be added to Github Release pages
	- Should be an option in the autobuild config script:
		- Pre-build script
		- Post-build script
		- Extra files to add to releases
	- Should be configured PER-PACKAGE

- Can autobuild determine the build dependency packages just by reading debian/control, rather than having them specified separately in the config file?
	This of course assumes a well-formed package, but I don't think that's unreasonable.

- Autobuild should store local versions of the package repositories in question and just pull changes rather than cloning from scratch every time
