The numbering to this todo list does not necessarily imply any order of priority.
TODO:

- #1 | Customizable build farm
	User-provided ISOs, etc, added on to the build farm list
	Option to build only *some* of the VMs (eg, i386 but not arm64)

- #2 | Add option for "extra commands" / extra files to be added to Github Release pages
	- Should be an option in the autobuild config script:
		- Pre-build script
		- Post-build script
		- Extra files to add to releases
	- Should be configured PER-PACKAGE

- #3 | Autobuild should be able to "update" or "replace" a release which has already been made
	For example, a GitHub release page has already been published for package Foo 1.2.3
	This release page included binaries for x86_64 and i386
	The developer would now like to run autobuild to create a package for arm64, without having to re-publish the package as a "new version" just because of a change in the way it's distributed.
	This change would go nicely with #2.

- #4 | The build-farm VM QEMU commands should be generated intelligently rather than relying on pre-scripted makefiles
	For instance, why do we assume that the user is running on x86_64 architecture?
	Why do we assume that the user's machine is capable of KVM acceleration?
	Why do we assume that the '22222' port is available?
	These things should be checked AT RUNTIME and adjusted accordingly
	This change would go hand-in-hand with #5 and #1.

- #5 | Add option to run build-farm VMs in parallel
	User should be able to choose how many VMs run simultaneously

- #6 | Build an optional web interface?
	Autobuild could be deployed to some server somewhere and you could have it distribute your changes remotely. Might be nice.

- #7 | Consolidate the contents of the autobuild-setup script into either (1) the main script or (2) a config file
	No reason we should have two scripts to this package.

- #8 | Get rid of the "debian_distribution" and "host_architecture" variables from the autobuild config. Why are they there? I don't like them and they shouldn't have to be there.

- #9 | Get rid of the arbitrary "sleep" commands after starting build VMs. There's got to be some way to just get a signal or otherwise figure out when it's finally online and ready.

- #10 | Add option to skip "host-machine" builds and only build on the build farm VMs
