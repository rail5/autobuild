autobuild (3.1.7) stable; urgency=medium

  * Copy config file to /var/autobuild on new installs in -s

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sun, 29 Sep 2024 08:27:23 +0800

autobuild (3.1.6) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added config file editor to autobuild -s

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sun, 22 Sep 2024 14:49:08 +0800

autobuild (3.1.5) stable; urgency=medium

  * Enable contents listing by default to work with apt-file

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sun, 08 Sep 2024 16:48:01 +0800

autobuild (3.1.4) stable; urgency=medium

  * Allow user to pull from private repos
    If the user has provided the necessary credentials in their config
    file, there's no reason that autobuild shouldn't permit them to
    pull packages from private repos

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sun, 08 Sep 2024 12:24:31 +0800

autobuild (3.1.3) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed possible trouble with boot order when installing arm64 vm
  * Fixed stateless builds on arm64
    Through a mindless and embarrassing oversight, the arm64 vm was
    not run in stateless mode. It is now
  * Correctly parsing changelogs which contain asterisks

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Tue, 03 Sep 2024 18:21:17 +0800

autobuild (3.1.2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Forcefully set 755 on /var/autobuild. This should fix autobuild on
    Ubuntu

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Fri, 23 Aug 2024 11:34:41 +0800

autobuild (3.1.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Output daemon errors to the socket until we're more production-ready
    Cover for pushing to Debian repo if source package was a tar archive
    Help the daemon find fresh repo directories

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 18 Jul 2024 16:07:43 +0800

autobuild (3.1.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Autobuild now creates a new Debian repo for the user, rather than
    relying on the user already owning one.
    This repo can be shipped either as a GitHub Pages
    site, or via some web server on the host machine, etc. We just
    create the files.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sat, 01 Jun 2024 16:36:02 +0800

autobuild (3.0.2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Patched some bugs with v3 debian repo pushing. Github email now must
    be stored in config file, unfortunately. This, the username, and the
    access token are necessary to push changes -- previously, this
    wasn't a problem, when autobuild was run as the user (rather than as
    the _autobuild system user), because we could assume that the user
    had their git configured properly. But now that we're operating out
    of /var/autobuild with a system user distinct from the normal user,
    we need to handle this ourselves. In the meantime, reprepro was
    complaining about being unable to find .tar.xz files which were
    necessary to publish changes. I'm not sure if reprepro changed, in
    that it didn't require these before, or if debuild changed, in that
    it used to produce .tar.gz files instead of .tar.xz files, or
    neither changed but something else happened. In either case,
    autobuild now saves tar archives of ANY kind, where before it used
    to only save .tar.gz files, from debuild.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Fri, 31 May 2024 17:14:04 +0800

autobuild (3.0.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Removed (now unneeded) dependency and updated manual

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Fri, 31 May 2024 16:14:28 +0800

autobuild (3.0.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Version 3 release
    Autobuild is now separated into a daemon and a client. The daemon
    runs as a systemd service which is opened upon contact with an
    autobuild unix socket file. The client contacts the daemon via
    this socket.
    The build farm VMs are now stored in /var/autobuild and are
    modifiable only by the _autobuild user. This is much more secure
    The -c option has been removed.
    A new -r option has been added to remove old builds in the
    /var/autobuild/builds directory.
    The -p option can now take arguments that are either: (1) the
    names of packages in the config file, (2) valid git URLs, or (3)
    file paths to locally-stored tar.gz archives.
    The field in the config file for GPG-encrypted access tokens has
    been removed, however the config file is now readable only by
    the _autobuild user and root.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 30 May 2024 19:00:04 +0800

autobuild (2.3.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Removed redundant code, reorganized code, general code cleanup

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Mon, 27 May 2024 17:54:03 +0800

autobuild (2.3.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Replaced build farm makefiles with proper shell scripts which can
    be hosted outside of the user directory. This improves security,
    in reducing attack surface by removing executed scripts from user
    directories, and also improves stylistic consistency -- previously
    autobuild could be described as 'two parts' separated from each
    other.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sun, 26 May 2024 14:38:34 +0800

autobuild (2.2.4) stable; urgency=medium

  * Patched a bug with -l
    -l was previously broken by the same update which broke -c. Clearly
    that update wasn't thought through well enough
    Check lsof to see when we can boot the VM again

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sat, 25 May 2024 19:46:37 +0800

autobuild (2.2.3) stable; urgency=medium

  * Ensure that the user local directory is properly configured before
    continuing. This code was previously moved because we didn't want
    autobuild to go through the trouble of parsing the config file until
    AFTER we knew what the user wanted to do. That change made a lot of
    things a lot faster, however, the portion of code that checks that
    there IS a config file, etc, really should remain at the top.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sat, 25 May 2024 10:26:12 +0800

autobuild (2.2.2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Initialize the config file variable at the top of the file
    This patches a bug that caused '-c' to do nothing at all.
    Only run VM shutdown if the sshport has been changed from its
    initial value

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Fri, 24 May 2024 21:12:57 +0800

autobuild (2.2.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Signal trapping for graceful exits in autobuild-setup
    Parse config only after parsing option arguments
    A single echo is sufficient to clean the terminal window after
    a curses display

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sun, 05 May 2024 12:11:56 +0800

autobuild (2.2.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Autobuild-setup now has a proper curses display.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sat, 04 May 2024 15:53:06 +0800

autobuild (2.1.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Graceful exits and more helpful error messages

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Fri, 03 May 2024 22:28:56 +0800

autobuild (2.1.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added support for creating forgejo release pages with -f option

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Fri, 03 May 2024 21:04:24 +0800

autobuild (2.0.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed tiny possibility that generated telnet and ssh ports for VMs
    would be the same
    Consolidated update function into one single upgrade_vm call

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 02 May 2024 22:35:26 +0800

autobuild (2.0.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * v2 release
    VMs are now stateless during package builds. This means that the
    state of the build farm virtual machines is not altered by the
    building of any one package. This reduces the chance that we might
    corrupt our build environments.
    All builds now happen in build VMs by default, unless a local build
    is requested by the user. Added -l option to list available packages.
    Removed 'interactive mode'
    Config file is now TOML rather than a shell script. Much easier to
    read, much easier to edit, much less dangerous.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 02 May 2024 15:33:07 +0800

autobuild (1.11.12) stable; urgency=medium

  * Users can now choose to build (if they want) only some of the build
    farm VMs. This used to be all-or-nothing, but users can now select
    which ones they want, if any, etc
    General code cleanup
    Bugfix: asking for cross-compilation when VMs aren't configured no
    longer hangs indefinitely

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sun, 28 Apr 2024 15:07:39 +0800

autobuild (1.11.11) stable; urgency=medium

  * Replaced bell.wav with bell.ogg, reducing file size 10x
    Telnet ports for the VMs are now randomized

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sat, 27 Apr 2024 18:54:53 +0800

autobuild (1.11.10) stable; urgency=medium

  * Assume the host machine has necessary build-deps. This removes an
    unwanted prompt for interactive input called by sudo
    Autobuild now connects to the build farm VMs as soon as it can
    Fixed a bug where build-farm scripts did not upgrade with the
    package
    Now running the view-progress script from /usr/share instead of
    home
    Progress terminal window exits after completion

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sat, 27 Apr 2024 17:59:31 +0800

autobuild (1.11.9) stable; urgency=medium

  * Improved build dependency handling by using mk-build-deps
    Now calling build-farm scripts from /usr/share instead of home
    Statically included base packaging dependencies in the build-farm
    VM preseeds
    Also changed the repo mirror to the global URL deb.debian.org

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sat, 27 Apr 2024 15:18:56 +0800

autobuild (1.11.8) stable; urgency=medium

  * More code cleanup. Patched two bugs: one which would have
  affected users with spaces in their usernames (an unquoted
  string), and one which (through a silly oversight) affected
  packages which included the word 'changes' in their names,
  preventing autobuild from pushing them to Debian repos.
  General code style improvements as well.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Mon, 22 Apr 2024 19:32:05 +0800

autobuild (1.11.7) stable; urgency=medium

  * Some minor code cleanup with the help of shellcheck

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sun, 21 Apr 2024 10:05:12 +0800

autobuild (1.11.6) stable; urgency=medium

  * Generalizing the build-farm launch system, or rather,
  beginning to generalize it. We should determine things like
  the SSH ports, the kind of acceleration, etc, intelligently,
  rather than relying on pre-scripted hard-coded makefiles
  as autobuild has so far.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sun, 21 Apr 2024 10:04:33 +0800

autobuild (1.11.5) stable; urgency=medium

  * Cleaned up the ancient autobuild-setup script, also now
  have default N on some y/n prompts in autobuild's
  interactive mode.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Fri, 29 Dec 2023 16:31:32 +0800

autobuild (1.11.4) stable; urgency=medium

  * Patched a silly bug in the debian repo publishing function

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 21 Dec 2023 21:56:53 +0800

autobuild (1.11.3) stable; urgency=medium

  * Autobuild now has a mechanism to prevent unauthorized
  changes to locally-stored package sources by other users
  or processes, making sure that the version of the source
  pulled from the specified git repo takes precedence over
  any unpushed local changes.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 21 Dec 2023 21:51:10 +0800

autobuild (1.11.2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Autobuild now displays the build logs from the build-farm
  virtual machines in real-time, so that the user may witness
  any errors which may or may not come up, etc.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 21 Dec 2023 18:32:46 +0800

autobuild (1.11.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Autobuild now stores package sources in the user's .local
  directory, rather than cloning them anew each time we want
  to build them. This saves a lot of time when building large
  packages.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 21 Dec 2023 15:25:07 +0800

autobuild (1.11) stable; urgency=medium

  * Autobuild now detects package build dependencies by reading
  the debian/control file, and no longer requires that the user
  specify the package build-deps in the autobuild config file.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Tue, 19 Dec 2023 19:38:07 +0800

autobuild (1.10.4) stable; urgency=medium

  * Build farm VMs no longer clone repos separately

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sun, 26 Nov 2023 18:32:39 +0800

autobuild (1.10.3) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added 'addmake' to the config.example

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Fri, 13 Oct 2023 11:22:13 +0800

autobuild (1.10.2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Append newline to the end of autobuild's output to avoid
  messing up anyone's terminal window

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Mon, 25 Sep 2023 13:00:14 +0800

autobuild (1.10.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added stranslate to default config for my own convenience

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sun, 24 Sep 2023 12:50:11 +0800

autobuild (1.10) stable; urgency=medium

  * Replaced apt with apt-get for (hopefully) more reliability

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sat, 23 Sep 2023 16:13:46 +0800

autobuild (1.9) stable; urgency=medium

  * Apt appears to be giving sshpass
  scripting some serious trouble.
  I've patched it for now but this
  should be looked at soon

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Sat, 19 Aug 2023 00:06:03 -0400

autobuild (1.8) stable; urgency=medium

  * Patched small bug that caused
  occasional hanging on build-farm
  VM package updates

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Fri, 18 Aug 2023 23:55:06 -0400

autobuild (1.7) stable; urgency=medium

  * Moving everything to Debian 12

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Fri, 18 Aug 2023 23:11:13 -0400

autobuild (1.6) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * Autobuild now escapes quote-marks
  in changelog messages before pushing
  to Github release pages. A string
  "like this" would have failed before.
  Newlines are now escaped in a more
  sane way.

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Tue, 15 Aug 2023 15:48:10 -0400

autobuild (1.5) bullseye; urgency=medium
