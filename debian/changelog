autobuild (1.12-rc1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Generalizing the build-farm launch system, or rather,
  beginning to generalize it. We should determine things like
  the SSH ports, the kind of acceleration, etc, intelligently,
  rather than relying on pre-scripted hard-coded makefiles
  as autobuild has so far.

autobuild (1.11.3) stable; urgency=medium

  changes to locally-stored package sources by other users
  or processes, making sure that the version of the source
  pulled from the specified git repo takes precedence over

autobuild (1.11.2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Autobuild now displays the build logs from the build-farm
  virtual machines in real-time, so that the user may witness
  any errors which may or may not come up, etc.

autobuild (1.11.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Autobuild now stores package sources in the user's .local
  directory, rather than cloning them anew each time we want

  packages.

autobuild (1.11) stable; urgency=medium

  the debian/control file, and no longer requires that the user
  specify the package build-deps in the autobuild config file.
